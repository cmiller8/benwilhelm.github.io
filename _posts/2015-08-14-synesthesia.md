This is a project that's been kicking around in my head for about 8 years now, mostly just in theoretical form. Recently, The House Theatre and the University of Chicago provided me and my friend/collaborator Kevin O'Donnell some money and facilities to workshop a proof of concept.

## Syne-what?

[Synesthesia][1] is a _"neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway."_ It can manifest in any number of ways, where a synesthete might inherently associate different colors with specific letters and numbers, or specific shapes with different musical chords. My wife and I are both synesthetes, as are her two brothers and my mother. My wife sees even and odd numbers as cool and warm colors, respectively. She even sometimes refers to warm or cool numbers without realizing it. My synesthesia takes a more obscure form, where I associate the months of the year on a counterclockwise loop, with January at 12 o'clock, February at 11 o'clock, etc. The loop is twisted 90 degrees in the middle so that the bottom goes away from you. Kind of like this:

## Ok, cool.  So what?

Well, as I began reading about synesthesia, I recognized that this is how I approach lighting design. It should so seemlessly integrate with the action on stage and the other design elements (in my case, specifically sound) that it should feel as though you are sensing a single event with multilple modes, rather than an assembly of storytelling devices. It sounds obvious, but I think it is often forgotten.
